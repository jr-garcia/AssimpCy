About
========

AssimpCy aims to be a fast binding for `Assimp <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>`_.
It makes extensive use of memcpy function to achieve this goal, leading to awesome speed ups over `Pyassimp <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyassimp>`_.

To check this claim, install both **AssimpCy** and **Pyassimp** and the run :py:mod:`versus_demo.py` from `the repo <https://github.com/jr-garcia/AssimpCy/blob/master/examples/versus_demo.py>`_
