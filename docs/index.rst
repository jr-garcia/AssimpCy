   about

The simplest way to start using AssimpCy is installig with Pip::

    pip install assimpcy

That line should install the right binary wheel for your system.
The Assimp library (version 5.0.1) is included so you dont need to download it or compile it.

If that does not work, or if you want to update the Assimp library included in AssimpCy, please refer to :doc:`/install` for instructions.
